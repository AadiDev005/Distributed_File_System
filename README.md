# DataVault Enterprise
**Distributed file system inspired by Kubernetes etcd - Database-free consensus storage**

---

## 💡 **Inspiration**

Inspired by **Kubernetes etcd architecture** while fixing critical kubelet & HPA bugs (PR #133072, #133415). Instead of using databases, DataVault applies **custom Raft consensus** to file storage - just like etcd manages Kubernetes cluster state without databases.

---

## 🏗️ **What it is**

A production-ready distributed file system with:
- ✅ **Custom Raft Consensus** (no databases needed)
- ✅ **Byzantine Fault Tolerance** + **Post-Quantum Crypto**
- ✅ **Real-time Collaboration** with operational transforms
- ✅ **Enterprise Security** (11-layer stack)
- ✅ **99.9% Availability** across distributed nodes
